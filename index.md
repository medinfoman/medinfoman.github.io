## Hello World

I am interested in NLP(Natural language processing) using Deep learning, Traditional Machine learning.
I am a Ph.D student in BioEngineering course in Seoul National University (S. Korea).
Recently, I have been making BERT model for Korean and some other polymerizable works with NLP engineering.
